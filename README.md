# RustCrawler
Rust application to learn rust and crawl entities on the web

## Ideas

- Fetching google results
- Recursive links fetching
- Assigning type and recursion to links
- save in db (for now sqllite)
- parse results for pertinance and info
- classify and index by relevance

## TODOs

- [ ] Fetch links and save them
    - [X] Check that robot file does not disallow scrap
    - [ ] Rust google calls or on api. search for a solution (https://serpdog.io/blog/web-scraping-google-with-rust/)
    - [ ] Rust sqlite interface
    - [ ] Result as cli
